<h1>The best movies/Dramas I've watched in 2024</h1>
<h2>My top three movies</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Joe (Tamil)</h3>
<p>One of my most favorite coming of age love films, with reference to the current generation's perception on love</p>
<h3>Sita Ramam (Pan India)</h3>
<p>It's been more than a year since the release of the movie. But it's still fresh in my mind.<br/>
(P.S: in love with the bgm and it's still my ringtone!)</p>
<h3>Don't Disturb My Study (CDrama)</h3>
<p>One of the best study dramas I've watched, with no conventional romance and a perfect asian dramas for study lovers like me!</p>
